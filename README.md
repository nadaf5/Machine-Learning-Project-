# Mental Health in Tech Survey – Machine Learning Analysis

## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive machine learning analysis of the Mental Health in Tech Survey dataset.
The goal is to explore factors influencing mental health treatment among professionals in the technology sector
using both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – Mental Health in Tech Survey
- Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey
- Size: 1,259 responses
- Target Variable: treatment (Yes / No)

## Models Used
### Supervised Learning
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

### Unsupervised Learning
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering

## Results Summary
- Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy (~79%)
- Hierarchical Clustering achieved the best silhouette score (~0.35)

## Conclusion
Tree-based models handled non-linear relationships better, while hierarchical clustering revealed
clear participant groupings within the dataset.
